# Week 1 Progress - Phase 0: Repository Setup

**Date:** 2025-12-01

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 0.3 - Repository Creation
- [x] Initialized local Git repository
- [x] Created directory structure
- [x] Set up .gitignore for Python, Docker, Terraform, AWS
- [x] Created initial README.md
- [x] Set up documentation structure

### Repository Structure
Created the following directories:
- `app/` - Future home of FastAPI application
- `tests/` - Test suite
- `docker/` - Docker configurations
- `kubernetes/` - K8s manifests (base, local, aws)
- `terraform/` - IaC with module structure
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipelines
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `alembic/` - Database migrations

## Decisions Made

1. **Repository Name:** Chose "grimoire" (grimoire = book of knowledge/formulas, fitting for blueprint collection)
2. **Branch Name:** Using "main" instead of "master"
3. **Structure:** Mono-repo approach with organized modules

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Initial commit and push
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules (Phase 0.4)
- [ ] Create first feature branch (Phase 0.4)
